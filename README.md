# 2025 Advent of Code with JavaScript
Back for a third year of Advent of Code, this time using JavaScript and Node.js.

## Day 1
Use modulo to keep resulting value inside the value range and figure out how many rotations has happened.

## Day 2
Part 1: Check if any number in range is evenly divisible by 2.  
Part 2: Use prime number factorization to check if numbers in ranges matches repeat patterns.

## Day 3
Use pointers to find largest number in sequence.

## Day 4
Part 1: Loop through map once and check each adjacent position, sum number of rolls and check if roll is accessible.  
Part 2: Same as part 1, but loop though map multiple times and remove rolls until no more accessible rolls are found.

## Day 5
Part 1: Simply looping each ingredient ID and checking against intervals.  
Part 2: Merging overlapping intervals to be able to use subtraction to find result.
